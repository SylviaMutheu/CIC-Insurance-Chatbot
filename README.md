# CIC Policy Inquiry Chatbot (POC)
### üìå Overview
An AI-driven Policy Inquiry Chatbot developed for CIC Insurance to enhance customer support by providing automated, 24/7 assistance for common policy inquiries. The Proof of Concept (POC) aimed to validate the chatbot's ability to reduce reliance on human agents, ensure seamless query escalation, and improve customer satisfaction across health, auto, and home insurance categories.

### üéØ Objectives
#### Project Goals:
- Automate Customer Support: Enable self-service for common insurance inquiries to reduce human intervention and operational overhead.
- Improve Accessibility: Provide 24/7 real-time assistance across CIC‚Äôs web and mobile platforms.
- Streamline Escalation: Implement a seamless escalation process to human agents for complex or urgent inquiries.
- Validate Technology Feasibility: Assess the chatbot‚Äôs effectiveness for future scalability and more advanced customer journeys.
#### Key Problems Solved:
- Operational Efficiency: Reduced the workload on human agents by automating frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- After-Hours Support: Addressed the gap in customer service by providing continuous assistance outside of business hours.
- Faster Response Time: Improved response speed for common queries while ensuring complex issues are promptly escalated.
- Data Collection & Insights: Captured user interaction data to analyze common pain points and improve future service delivery.
#### Unique Aspects:
- Zero-Touch Journey: Users complete simple inquiries without human intervention.
- Smart Escalation Logic: Escalates complex cases to human agents using predefined criteria (e.g., urgency, complexity, policy type).
- No-Code Development: Leveraged WeWeb and Xano for rapid deployment and easy configuration.
- After-Hours Ticketing: Automatically generates tickets for unresolved issues during non-business hours, enhancing service continuity.
